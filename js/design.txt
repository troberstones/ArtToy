            circle
            elipse
            star
            text
        symetry mode
    selection:
        Group
        layer
        single selection
        multi selection
        remove from selection
        box selection
        lasso selection
        Selection targets:
            Shapes
            Groups
            points
    Selection operations:
        Alignments:
            Center
                to page
            align
                tops/left
                bottoms/right
                CenterV/CenterH
            Distribute:
                centers
                distanecs between tops and bottoms/sides
        Clip
            set current selection as clip
        Group
        Booleans
            union
            difference
            combine
        Transform:
                around pivot
                around selection center

            Scale selection
            move selection
            rotate selection
            transform pivot
            Mirror/flip
        Duplicate:
            Shapes
                copy
                array - copy number and xform
                along path
                blend 2 Shapes
                duplicate and repeat steps untill repeat is pressed again like a macro
    Outliner
        - I now have a primitive layer interface
            it allows active layer
            layer visibility
            draft view
    Import
    Save
    quick Save
    scrip process curves
        houdini for curves
    view transforms:
        zoom
        rotate
        flip

major classes:
    Selection 
        holds the selected data, there can be on or many
        provides access to the current pivot
        provides the active selection mode
    transformer
        works on selection
        draws active manipulator widgit
    Tool
        handles creation and mouse event proessing for the creation of defined shape
        When activated the tool takes over event handling
    color manipulator
        like a tool
        works on selection
    event processor:
        provides information about the current event so that it can be uniformly consumed
        either that or just use the native event data
            still need to have something provide the click data transfomed by the view transform
    Multi touch event processor:
        provide support for zoom, and undo and gestures
UI elements:
    Color palette
        gradient
        image
        swatches
    Color adjustor:
        HSV
        RGB
        HSL
        Cyan->magenta adjust, yellow->? adjust 
            Look at nuke grade node
    Manipulator widget
    Flyout support for tool settings
        This could be alignment controls
        Boolean controls
        Shape settings
        numerical transform controls
        text controls
