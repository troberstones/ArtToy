    Don't use html elements just canvas that way the canvas can be full screen
        Pro:
            No crazy css to make the whole thing work
        Con:
            Have to provide more structure, and build UI elements like list view which could come 
            automatically from html
        Todo: how hard is it to create a list view in canvas, 
        how hard is it to float a list view in a floating div?
        
    entry can provide organization
